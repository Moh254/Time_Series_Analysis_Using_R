### Time Series Analysis on a Tourism dataset
# The objective of the project
This project will implement Time series analysis on a Tourism dataset to understand the underlying trends, and it will try to forecast the future.

### Data
The data selected is a Thailand Tourism dataset.

We filter data that only contains UK touristâ€™s data and we will split it in 2 parts. The first part will be the training dataset that will contain the years 2010,2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015. The validation dataset will just contain 2016. After this will convert the both datasets in time series objects.

Accuracy measures for a forecast model;

ME: Mean Error

RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error

MAE: Mean Absolute Error

MPE: Mean Percentage Error

MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error

MASE: Mean Absolute Scaled Error

ACF1: Autocorrelation of errors at lag 1.

### Conclusion
Time Series Analysis is an excellent method to analyse and predict trends. In additions is very simple to implement and to understand the results. The implementation of the Time Series Analysis has achieved its purpose of illustrating the process of analysing the trends and forecasting.
